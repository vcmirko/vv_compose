# Intro
This project is a simple docker-compose to quickly get you started with AnsibleForms.
The docker compose will spin up the mysql database and grab the latest AnsibleForms image from docker hub.
It will install everything with defaults and present a dummy playbook as well as a demo forms.json file.
The Ansibleforms image comes with Ansible and Python3 (and some galaxy collections), so apart from docker and docker compose there are no prerequisites.

# How to Install
Simply follow the instructions on (https://ansibleforms.com)
